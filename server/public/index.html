                <p>Hi, I'm Jingming Liu. I'm currently doing my MS in Computer Science in the US, and before that I studied Software Engineering in China. I really enjoy building things with code, and I've worked with Python, C++, Java, and many other frameworks.<br><br>
                    What excites me most is combining technical problem-solving with product thinking to create useful, scalable solutions. I'm looking forward to bringing that mindset to new challenges in the future.</p>
